    "description": "In arithmetic and algebra, the cube of a number n is its third power, that is, the result of multiplying three instances of n together. The cube of a number or any other mathematical expression is denoted by a superscript 3, for example 23 = 8 or (x + 1)3.\\r\\n' +\r\n    //           '\\r\\n' +\r\n    //           'The cube is also the number multiplied by its square:\\r\\n' +\r\n    //           '\\r\\n' +\r\n    //           'n3 = n × n2 = n × n × n.\\r\\n' +\r\n    //           'The cube function is the function x ↦ x3 (often denoted y = x3) that maps a number to its cube.
